        <h3>Foods:</h3>
        <p>Food is what gives us power, the fuel to chase the resposibilities we're given as human beings. It's the first basic need of a 
            human. But it's not just the survival tool humans consume. It's what sometimes brings people closer and make the bond so 
            strong it was never before. It sometimes becomes the reason for a world of happiness to someone. So, food is not just 
            something we eat to survive, we share it to make it a reason for our smile, peace, and happiness at the end of the day. <br>

        <h4>Here are some of my favourite foods I can think of right now:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biryani-</strong><br>
                    In the matter of favourite food, I'm gonna choose Biryani. It has to be at the top of the list. It has been my 
                    favourite food as long as i can remember. It's common in Bangladesh, and every house tells a different story with 
                    their Biryani. It's a dish made with finest rice, meat (whether it's chicken or beef) and different kinds of spices. 
                    It's delicious!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Jhalmuri-</strong><br>
                    Jhalmuri. In the name itself it's telling what kind of food it's gonna be. It's spicy puffed rice. Made with 
                    lots of spices. Its sharp taste attracts me the most. Whenever I have a get-together with my friends the food's 
                    always gonna be Jhalmuri. I may be the reason for many of my friends Jhalmuri 'addiction'.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shingara-</strong><br>
                    Flour coated potatoes in a triangular shape dish is called Shingara. It has that ability to shock a human with 
                    massive taste flow over the toungue. It is one of the most eaten snacks in Bangladesh. It's beautiful in taste 
                    and looks.
